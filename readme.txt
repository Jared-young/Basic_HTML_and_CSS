This folder contains the numerous projects I worked on through my HTML and CSS course at the tech academy. 

I created several websites to help me gain experince coding.

Inside the basic html website you will find my first web page that shows an example of a driver's education program with a signup form to learn more. 

I also created a personal website that shares my professional experinces from this course and well as my professional interests. 

For the latest section of the course I updated this personal website to be a lot more interactive! 

Throughout my latest course on JavaScript I have completed 13 different projects ranging from very simplistic alerts to a pizza comapnies website where you can place an online order. I also created a tic tac toe game that can be played against a computer!
