This folder contains the numerous projects I worked on through my HTML and CSS course at the tech academy. 

I created several websites to help me gain experince coding.

Inside the basic html website you will find my first web page that shows an example of a driver's education program with a signup form to learn more. 

I also created a personal website that shares my professional experinces from this course and well as my professional interests.
